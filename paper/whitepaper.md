## Executive Summary

This white paper introduces **Resonance Principles** as a foundational concept within 
the Resonance Data and Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing (QIRC) paradigm.

Fundamental principles governing resonance phenomena

This publication follows the **VSP - Vega Safety Protocol**.

---

## 1. Motivation

Current AI systems excel at:
- Storing information
- Computing similarity
- Generating responses

They cannot:
- Stabilize insight over time
- Preserve wisdom as coherent meaning
- Model decisions beyond ranking

Resonance Principles addresses this conceptually.

---

## 2. Definition

**Resonance Principles** is defined as:

> Fundamental principles governing resonance phenomena

---

## 3. Core Properties

### 3.1 Meaning as Resonance
Relevance emerges from resonance strength, not vector distance.

### 3.2 Temporal Coherence
Wisdom arises when resonance remains stable over time.

### 3.3 Resonance Collapse
Decisions emerge as state collapse from superposition.

## 4. What This Is

- A conceptual framework
- A contribution to Resonance Data paradigm
- Prior art establishing authorship
- Foundation for future research

---

## 5. What This Is NOT

- NOT new physics
- NOT quantum hardware
- NOT implementation or algorithm
- NOT consciousness claim

---

## 6. VSP Compliance

This publication adheres to the **Vega Safety Protocol**:
